This is a temporary email which is mainly used for testing automation. The goal is to make this something similar to 10minutemail but hosted locally 
It can generate temporary email address meant to be used and discard. It can also received email

1. In command prompt run,  
docker build -t tempmail .

2. Then run
docker-compose up -d

To use postman to generate email, first generate a domain
http://localhost/v1/domainchecker (POST), select graphQL

mutation {
   createDomain(
       input: {
          host: "test.com"
       }
       )
       {
         _id
         host
         count_emails
       }
}

Then copy the domain_id, then change the status of the domain to true

mutation {
   editDomain(
       domain_id: "60128810330e300014f419ad", 
       input:{ 
           status: true
           }
        )
       {
         _id
         status
         host
         created_at
         count_emails
       }
}

Then generate email
mutation {
    createEmail
        {
            _id
            email
            created_at
        }
}

sample response would be like This{
    "data": {
        "createEmail": {
            "_id": "60128879330e300014f419ae",
            "email": "hulbig-dyann38@test2.com",
            "created_at": "2021-01-28T09:48:41.832Z"
        }
    }
}

You can then fire an email either by using telnet or using any to send to localhost port 25
